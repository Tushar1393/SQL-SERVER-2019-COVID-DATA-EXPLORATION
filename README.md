# SQL-SERVER-2019-COVID-DATA-EXPLORATION

In this project the main focus was to explore the covid data and to take look at the current status on the number of cases accross the world.
AND used some intermidiate to advance level querying in the project.

The code is parted in two way one for the covid death and other one for the covid vaccination in the same script.
